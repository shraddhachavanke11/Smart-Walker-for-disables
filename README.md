The system aims to design a smart walker that helps visually impaired people improve their mobility and stability. 
The proposed system uses a combination of computer vision, ultrasonic sensors, and real-time audio feedback to increase the mobility and safety of blind people during navigation. 
The Smart Walker has an onboard camera that scans the surroundings and uses computer vision (CV) techniques to detect obstacles and estimate the object's distance. 
The accuracy of the system is 86.25 percent.
